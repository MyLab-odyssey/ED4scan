Retrieve battery diagnostic data from your smart electric drive EV. Get a Status Report to rate the health of the battery or dig into more detailed measurements.  

>**Further documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MyLab-odyssey/ED_BMSdiag/wiki).**

>**The development is now finished with the final release of v1.0.1 .**  

>**The software will only work on the third generation Smart electric drive vehicle build from late 2012 to mid 2015.**

## You need
An Arduino with CAN bus shield to connect to the diagnostics port (OBDII-connector) of your car. Find information about usable [CAN-Shields here](https://github.com/MyLab-odyssey/ED_BMSdiag/wiki/CAN-Bus-Basics). If you have trouble getting a CAN connection please see the [Troubleshooting and Tips](https://github.com/MyLab-odyssey/ED_BMSdiag/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-Tips) section.

Get the hardware and use an appropriate cable for the physical connection. See the schematics for making your own cable.

<p/>

## Get started
* Download the [repo-ZIP](https://github.com/MyLab-odyssey/ED_BMSdiag/archive/master.zip), then copy the files to your **Arduino folder** (location depends on OS). The folder structure should look like this:

* Open the ED_BMSdiag.ino file and compile / upload it to the Arduino board.  

* **Find detailed installation instructions in: [english](https://github.com/MyLab-odyssey/ED_BMSdiag/wiki/Installation) | [german](https://github.com/MyLab-odyssey/ED_BMSdiag/wiki/Installation_DE).**

> **Verified to work with Arduino IDE 1.8.4 (on OS X 10.12 and WIN-Systems)**

## Usage >on your own risk<
Connect the CAN shield to the OBDII-connector and power up the car.

This simple tool will display the diagnostics via a serial USB connection. The readout will be started by entering commands after the prompt. See the [Wiki for further details of the CLI](https://github.com/MyLab-odyssey/ED_BMSdiag/wiki/Command-Line-Interface).


>**You need to open the serial monitor of the Arduino-IDE.  Verify that it is set to CR = Carriage Return and the baud rate is 115200.**
